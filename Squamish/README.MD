This project analyzes the **bus network of Squamish, BC**, using graph theory and centrality measures. The aim is to understand the structure and connectivity of the network, identifying key bus stops based on their importance within the system. The analysis provides insights into the overall functionality and efficiency of the transportation network.

## Overview

The bus network is represented as a graph, where:
- **Nodes** represent bus stops.
- **Edges** represent direct routes or connections between stops.

The analysis employs **centrality metrics** to evaluate the relative importance of each bus stop:
- **Degree Centrality**: Measures the number of direct connections a bus stop has.
- **Eigenvector Centrality**: Assesses the influence of a bus stop based on the connectivity of its neighbors.

## Objectives

- Visualize the bus network and its structure.
- Identify key bus stops based on their connectivity and influence.
- Provide recommendations for improving the efficiency of the network.
